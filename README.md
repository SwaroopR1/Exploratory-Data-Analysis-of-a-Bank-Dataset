# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a Bank's Marketing Campaign Dataset
---
I undertook this project during my **Finlatics' Data Science Experience Program**.

In this project, I used **Python** to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a **Portuguese bank's marketing dataset** to derive useful insights. The following files are included in this repository:

1. **Problem Statement & Data Description.docx**: Contains the dataset description and key questions to be answered through EDA.
2. **banking_data.csv**: The raw dataset used for analysis.
3. **Modules_for_Project**: A directory containing interconnected Python modules:

   - The 'main()' module serves as the entry point, calling other modules as needed.
   
   - Each module is designed to fulfill specific objectives.
   
4. **Data_Analysis.pdf**: A PDF version of a PowerPoint presentation summarizing demographic trends and insights.
5.  **Code_Data_Analysis.pdf**: A PDF version of a PowerPoint presentation explaining the Python modules' functionality, observed demographics, and insights.
